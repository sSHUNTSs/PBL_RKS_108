Project Title: Web-Based Cybersecurity Development to Enhance Programming Literacy and Data Management

Description: 
"Development of a web-based application that prioritizes cybersecurity by using the Vigen√®re Cipher algorithm for data encryption. The primary goal of this development is to enhance programming literacy and improve data management capabilities.

Users can encrypt and decrypt data, perform brute force attacks on encrypted data, encrypt text files, and send messages securely to other users, as these messages are encrypted within the database."

Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.
